# Frequently Asked Questions

This document addresses common questions about the TransJakarta Pathfinder project and the algorithms implemented.

## Algorithm Questions

### Q: Why does Dijkstra's algorithm show fewer nodes than BFS in the visualization?

**A:** Dijkstra's algorithm and BFS explore the graph differently:

- **Dijkstra's algorithm** explores nodes based on their cumulative distance from the source. It uses a priority queue to always select the node with the smallest known distance next. This means it focuses exploration on promising paths and may never explore distant nodes that are unlikely to be on the shortest path.

- **BFS** explores nodes based on their level (hop count) from the source. It explores all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level, regardless of their potential to be on the shortest path. This level-by-level approach leads to exploring more nodes.

The visualization shows all nodes that each algorithm has "touched" or considered during its execution, which is why BFS typically shows more nodes.

### Q: How do you determine which nodes to show in the visualization?

**A:** The nodes shown in the visualization are determined by:

1. **Algorithm Execution Records**: During algorithm execution, we record each step, including which nodes have been visited. The visualization shows all nodes that were "touched" or considered by the algorithm.

2. **Relevance to the Path**: Nodes that are part of the final path are highlighted differently. Nodes that were visited but not part of the final path show how the algorithm explored different options.

3. **Proximity to the Route**: For clarity, the visualization focuses on nodes that are relevant to the route finding process. Very distant nodes that were never considered by either algorithm aren't shown.

### Q: Why might Dijkstra and BFS find different paths between the same stations?

**A:** Dijkstra and BFS optimize for different metrics:

- **Dijkstra** finds the path with the shortest total travel time (considering the weights of edges).
- **BFS** finds the path with the fewest number of stations (edges), regardless of travel time.

For example, Dijkstra might choose a route with more stations if the total travel time is shorter, while BFS will always choose the route with the fewest stations even if the total travel time is longer.

### Q: What are the time and space complexities of these algorithms?

**A:** The complexities are:

**Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
- Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
- Space Complexity: O(V) for storing distances, previous nodes, and the priority queue

**BFS**:
- Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
- Space Complexity: O(V) for storing visited nodes, previous nodes, and the queue

BFS has better theoretical time complexity, but Dijkstra is often more efficient in practice for finding shortest paths because it explores fewer nodes.

### Q: How are edge weights calculated in this project?

**A:** Edge weights represent travel time in minutes between stations and are calculated based on:

1. **Geographic Distance**: We calculate the straight-line distance between stations using their latitude and longitude coordinates.

2. **Travel Time Estimation**: We estimate travel time using the formula:
   ```
   travel_time = (distance_in_km * 2) + 1
   ```
   This assumes an average bus speed of 30 km/h (2 minutes per km) plus 1 minute for station stops.

This is a simplified model for educational purposes. Real transit systems would use actual travel times based on historical data, traffic conditions, etc.

### Q: Why use a priority queue for Dijkstra but a simple queue for BFS?

**A:** The different data structures reflect the different exploration strategies:

- **Dijkstra** needs to always process the node with the smallest known distance next, which requires a priority queue to efficiently select this node.

- **BFS** processes nodes in the order they were discovered (first-in, first-out), which is perfectly handled by a simple queue.

The choice of data structure directly impacts the algorithm's behavior and efficiency.

## Implementation Questions

### Q: How do you record the algorithm steps for visualization?

**A:** During algorithm execution, we record the state at each step:

```typescript
// Record the current state as a step
steps.push({
  currentNode: currentNodeId,
  visitedNodes: [...visitedNodes],
  distances: { ...distances },
  previousNodes: { ...previousNodes },
});
```

This creates a sequence of snapshots that can be played back in the visualization to show how the algorithm progresses.

### Q: How is the graph visualization implemented?

**A:** The graph visualization uses D3.js with the following key components:

1. **Force Simulation**: D3's force layout positions nodes and edges based on physical forces.
2. **SVG Rendering**: Nodes and edges are rendered as SVG elements.
3. **Interactive Elements**: Nodes can be dragged, and hovering shows additional information.
4. **Dynamic Styling**: Node and edge styles change based on their state (unvisited, visited, current, path).

The visualization is synchronized with the algorithm steps to show the exploration process.

### Q: How do you measure algorithm performance metrics?

**A:** We collect several metrics during algorithm execution:

1. **Execution Time**: We measure the time taken using performance.now() before and after execution.
2. **Nodes Explored**: We count the number of nodes processed by the algorithm.
3. **Edges Processed**: We count the number of edges examined.
4. **Data Structure Operations**: We count priority queue or queue operations.
5. **Memory Usage**: We estimate memory usage based on the data structures used.

These metrics are displayed in the comparison view to highlight the differences between algorithms.

### Q: How accurate is the memory usage estimation?

**A:** The memory usage estimation is approximate and based on:

1. **Data Structure Size**: Estimated size of arrays, queues, and other data structures.
2. **Object Overhead**: Estimated JavaScript object overhead.
3. **Reference Counting**: Estimated memory for references between objects.

This is not a precise measurement but provides a relative comparison between algorithms. In a production environment, more accurate profiling tools would be used.

These comparisons help understand why certain algorithms are preferred in different scenarios.

### Q: What improvements could be made to the algorithms?

**A:** Several improvements could be implemented:

1. **Bidirectional Search**: Search from both source and destination simultaneously.
2. **A* Algorithm**: Use heuristics to guide the search more efficiently.
3. **Optimized Priority Queue**: Use a binary heap or Fibonacci heap for better performance.
4. **Preprocessing**: Precompute certain information to speed up queries.
