# OSRM Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) API to provide realistic road-based routing as an alternative to the existing straight-line routing. This enhancement makes the TransJakarta Pathfinder more realistic and demonstrates real-world application of pathfinding algorithms.

## What Was Added

### 1. Core OSRM Service (`lib/osrm-service.ts`)
- **Polyline Decoding**: Custom implementation to decode OSRM's encoded polyline geometry
- **Route Fetching**: Functions to get routes between two points or multiple waypoints
- **Caching System**: Automatic caching of OSRM responses to avoid repeated API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to straight-line routing if OSRM fails
- **Turn-by-Turn Instructions**: Extract detailed navigation instructions from OSRM

### 2. Enhanced Routing Service (`lib/enhanced-routing.ts`)
- **Mode Toggle**: Switch between "straight-line" and "osrm-realistic" modes
- **Route Segments**: Generate detailed route segments with coordinates and metadata
- **Metrics Calculation**: Enhanced metrics including realistic travel times and distances
- **Comparison Tool**: Compare both routing modes for the same path
- **Instruction Generation**: Create turn-by-turn navigation instructions

### 3. Updated Type Definitions (`lib/utils.ts`)
- **New Types**: Added `OSRMStep`, `OSRMResponse`, `RouteSegment`, `RoutingMode`
- **Enhanced Edge Type**: Added `osrmRoute` property to store OSRM data
- **Route Segment Type**: Structured data for enhanced route visualization

### 4. Enhanced Route Finder (`components/algorithm/route-finder.tsx`)
- **Routing Mode Toggle**: New dropdown to select between straight-line and OSRM modes
- **Enhanced State Management**: Track routing mode, segments, and metrics
- **Async Route Calculation**: Updated to handle OSRM API calls
- **Mode Indicator**: Visual indicator showing current routing mode

### 5. Updated Interactive Map (`components/map/interactive-map.tsx`)
- **Enhanced Route Rendering**: Display OSRM routes with actual road geometry
- **Realistic Polylines**: Show curved routes following actual roads
- **Enhanced Popups**: Include OSRM-specific information and turn instructions
- **Mode Indicator**: Legend shows current routing mode and metrics
- **Improved Styling**: Different styling for realistic vs straight-line routes

### 6. Demo Page (`app/routing-demo/page.tsx`)
- **Comparison Interface**: Side-by-side comparison of both routing modes
- **Sample Route**: Pre-configured route for demonstration
- **Detailed Analysis**: Show differences in distance, time, and route complexity
- **Turn Instructions**: Display OSRM turn-by-turn navigation
- **Educational Content**: Explain the differences between routing modes

### 7. Navigation Update (`components/layout/navbar.tsx`)
- **New Menu Item**: Added "OSRM Demo" link to showcase the new feature

## Key Features

### Routing Mode Toggle
- **Easy Switching**: Users can toggle between modes with a single dropdown
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators show which mode is active
- **Persistent State**: Mode selection persists during route calculations

### Realistic Road Routing
- **OSRM API Integration**: Uses the public OSRM API (router.project-osrm.org)
- **Actual Road Geometry**: Routes follow real roads instead of straight lines
- **Accurate Travel Times**: Based on actual driving conditions
- **Turn-by-Turn Instructions**: Detailed navigation instructions

### Performance Optimizations
- **Intelligent Caching**: OSRM responses are cached to reduce API calls
- **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to straight-line if OSRM fails
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking API calls with loading states
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for network issues

### Educational Value
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Shows how routing affects algorithm performance
- **Real-world Application**: Demonstrates practical use of pathfinding
- **Mode Comparison**: Direct comparison between theoretical and practical routing
- **Performance Impact**: Shows how realistic routing affects computation

## Technical Implementation

### OSRM API Usage
```typescript
// Get route between two points
const route = await getOSRMRoute(
  startLat, startLng, 
  endLat, endLng, 
  "driving"
);

// Get route for multiple waypoints
const multiRoute = await getOSRMRouteMultiple(
  waypoints, 
  "driving"
);
```

### Enhanced Routing Service
```typescript
// Set routing mode
enhancedRoutingService.setRoutingMode("osrm-realistic");

// Get enhanced route segments
const segments = await enhancedRoutingService.getRouteSegments(
  path, 
  graph
);

// Compare routing modes
const comparison = await enhancedRoutingService.compareRoutingModes(
  path, 
  graph
);
```

### Route Visualization
```typescript
// Render enhanced route segments
const renderEnhancedRouteSegments = () => {
  return routeSegments.map(segment => (
    <Polyline
      positions={segment.coordinates}
      color={segment.routeInfo.color}
      weight={routingMode === "osrm-realistic" ? 6 : 5}
    />
  ));
};
```
